## Feature Scope

ScamShield is an advanced fraud detection platform designed to protect users from suspicious calls by leveraging cutting-edge AI-driven audio analysis. The current scope of features includes:

- **Real-Time Audio Transcription:**  
  Converts call recordings into text using state-of-the-art models (e.g., Whisper) for accurate transcription, even in noisy environments.

- **Robust Audio Preprocessing:**  
  Employs advanced noise reduction and normalization techniques to enhance speech clarity and ensure reliable transcription.

- **Suspicious Call Detection:**  
  Uses a fine-tuned classification model to analyze transcribed text for key indicators of fraud, such as urgent language, OTP requests, and social engineering cues.

- **Explainability and Transparency:**  
  Integrates post-hoc explainability tools (e.g., LIME/SHAP, attention visualization) to highlight the factors contributing to a call being flagged, thereby building user trust.

- **Interactive Analytics Dashboard:**  
  Provides comprehensive, real-time insights including risk assessments, detailed reports, and instant alerts, all accessible via an intuitive web-based interface.

- **Secure User Authentication:**  
  Implements JWT-based authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive call data and analytics.

- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  Capable of processing audio in multiple languages (e.g., Hindi, Marathi) with ongoing improvements to expand language accuracy and coverage.

## Improvements

Planned enhancements and future directions for ScamShield include:

- **Enhanced User Interface and Experience:**  
  Redesign the dashboard with modern front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS) for a more intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing user experience.

- **Optimized Real-Time Processing:**  
  Improve the efficiency of audio processing and transcription to reduce latency, ensuring faster detection and alerting of suspicious calls.

- **Advanced Classification Models:**  
  Explore end-to-end audio classification and additional deep learning architectures to further boost detection accuracy and capture subtle fraud indicators.

- **Refined Explainability:**  
  Develop more granular and user-friendly explainability features to provide detailed insights into why specific calls are flagged, helping users make informed decisions.

- **Expanded Language and Dialect Coverage:**  
  Broaden the range of supported languages and regional dialects to better serve a diverse, global user base.

- **Mobile Responsiveness and App Development:**  
  Create a mobile-responsive interface or dedicated mobile app to allow users to monitor and receive alerts on the go.

- **Integration with Additional Data Sources:**  
  Incorporate supplementary data streams such as call metadata, user behavior analytics, and contextual information to enrich fraud detection capabilities.

- **Continuous Learning Feedback Loop:**  
  Implement a system to gather user feedback and real-world performance data, enabling continuous model refinement and reduction of false positives.

These improvements aim to make ScamShield not only more accurate and efficient but also more user-centric, ensuring a seamless, secure, and comprehensive solution for fraud detection in call communications.
